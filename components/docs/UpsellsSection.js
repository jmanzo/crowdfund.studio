                We’ve seen some amazing success from projects using Crowdfund Studio to upsell their backers,{' '}
                some projects raising over 30% extra on top of the revenue from Kickstarter/Indiegogo.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Typically we see best results when upsells are featured at a lower price than available on{' '}
                your website,{' '}possibly extending the campaign pricing just for the survey period.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Adding upsells is easy, just add link the upsell products you’ll like to display to the Shopify{' '}
                products you already have (or create new Shopify products).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                The order of upsells is determined by the order you upload them. If you want one to show up{' '}
                before another, upload that one first.
